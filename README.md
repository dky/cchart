# Crypto Table

A simple table to display your current portfolio. Built so I could learn how to make API calls with AJAX and learn JavaScript.

## TO-DO

- DRY up code and stop hard-coding everything.
- Figure out how to use React.
- Consolidate API call to a single call vs (n) separate calls.

## Feature/Enhancements

- Add marketcap value.
